# Royal Clothing

## What this project is:

This is an E-commerce project originally written in JavaScript but recently re-written in TypeScript. I hope that you enjoy playing around with it just as much as I enjoyed building it. Here's the [link to the website](https://crown-clothing-ikk.netlify.app/). Enjoy!

Many tools and libraries were used to build this project including, but not limited to: 
 - ContextAPI (as an initial state management tool)
 - Redux (later replaced ContextAPI)
 - Firestore (for storing "dummy" store data and user info)
 - Firebase (as a sign-up/sign-in authentication tool)
 - Stripe API (for making payments for the selected "products")
 - Sass (for the initial styling of the project)
 - Styled Components (later replaced Sass)
 ...
 
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
